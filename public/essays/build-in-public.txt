# Why I Build in Public

Shipping ugly work early taught me more than any course.

---

The first version of anything I build is almost always embarrassing. But I've learned that embarrassment is the price of learning fast.

Here's what building in public has taught me:

## 1. Feedback beats perfection

When you ship early, you get real feedback from real people. Not imaginary objections in your head. The gap between "what I thought users wanted" and "what users actually need" is always humbling.

## 2. Momentum compounds

Each shipped thing, no matter how small, creates momentum for the next. A week of planning feels productive but produces nothing. A week of shipping—even small, ugly things—builds a portfolio of proof.

## 3. You learn what matters

When you build in private, you optimize for the wrong things: clever code architecture, perfect naming conventions, edge cases that never happen. When you build in public, you optimize for what actually moves the needle.

I still cringe at early versions of my projects. But that cringe is evidence of growth. The alternative—never shipping—teaches you nothing.

Build ugly. Ship early. Learn fast.
