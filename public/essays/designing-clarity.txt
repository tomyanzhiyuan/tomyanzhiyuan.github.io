# Designing for Clarity

The single question I ask before adding any feature.

---

Every feature request sounds reasonable in isolation. Users ask for it. The team can build it. It would be "nice to have."

But features compound. Each one adds cognitive load, maintenance burden, and potential failure modes. The question isn't "can we build this?" It's: **"Does this make the core experience clearer or more confusing?"**

## The clarity test

Before adding anything, I ask: "If a new user sees this, will they understand the product better or worse?"

Most features fail this test. They add options. They create edge cases. They solve problems for 5% of users while confusing the other 95%.

## Subtraction is underrated

The best product decisions I've made weren't additions—they were removals. Killing a feature that "some users liked" to make the core experience obvious. Saying no to requests that would have diluted focus.

Clarity requires the courage to leave things out.

## Examples from my work

- Removed three navigation tabs to keep focus on the primary action
- Killed a "power user" settings panel that confused everyone else
- Chose a single, opinionated default over a configuration wizard

Each time, it felt risky. Each time, it was the right call.

Features are easy to add and hard to remove. Start with the minimum that achieves clarity. Add only when absolutely necessary.

The goal isn't a complete product. It's a clear one.
